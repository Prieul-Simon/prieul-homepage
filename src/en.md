# Hi,

## My name is Simon Prieul.

I am a senior software engineer with ten years of experience.
I am currently based in Toulouse, France.

Curious and passionated, fullstack developer in the web environment, expert and specialized in the Javascript ecosystem, 
my favorite technologies of the moment are [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Node](https://nodejs.org), [Bun](https://bun.sh), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).\
You can see my [social links here](https://links.prieul.fr), some of my public projects on [GitHub](https://links.prieul.fr/github) and you can also contact me at <span class="contact">sim<!-- sdfjsdhfkjypcs --><span class="block-spam" aria-hidden="true">PLEASE&nbsp;GO&nbsp;AWAY!</span>on.prieul(a<!-- sdfjsdhfkjypcs -->t)gm<!-- sdfjsdhfkjypcs -->ail.com</span>.

I am interested in code architecture and DX, and I am an adept of programming with a more declarative and functional approach 🚀.
> ✨ Code is for humans, not computers.

Outside of programming, I'm passionate about professional sports (I'm a fan
of [Cavaliers](https://www.nba.com/cavaliers) 🏀, [Stade Toulousain](https://www.stadetoulousain.fr) 🏉, [FDJ](https://www.equipecycliste-groupama-fdj.fr) 🚴, 
[Angers SCO](https://angers-sco.fr) ⚽ and [Roger Federer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0HbctxYnvU) 🎾). I'm also practicing squash and running weekly 🏃‍♂️.\
What's more, I'm a Magic The Gathering enthusiast and I
enjoy playing video games (<a href="https://www.playbalatro.com" target="_blank">Balatro</a> was my great favorite for 2024&nbsp;!).
